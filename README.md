## üìñ Abstract

<p>
Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generative models have shown impressive capabilities. However, these models are still inadequate in aligning synthesized videos with human preferences (e.g., accurately reflecting text descriptions), which is particularly difficult to address, as human preferences are inherently subjective and challenging to formalize as objective functions. Therefore, this paper proposes LiFT, a novel fine-tuning method leveraging human feedback for T2V model alignment. Specifically, we first construct a Human Rating Annotation dataset, LiFT-HRA, which includes approximately 10k human annotations comprising both a score and the corresponding rationale. 
Based on this, we train a reward model LiFT-Critic to learn human feedback-based reward function effectively, which serves as a proxy for human judgment, measuring the alignment between given videos and human expectations.
Lastly, we leverage the learned reward function to align the T2V model by maximizing the reward-weighted likelihood. 
As a case study, we apply our pipeline to CogVideoX-2B, showing that the fine-tuned model outperforms the CogVideoX-5B across all 16 metrics, highlighting the potential of human feedback in improving the alignment and quality of synthesized videos.
